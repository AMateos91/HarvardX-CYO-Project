# HarvardX-CYO-Project
This is my project for the last capstone module of the HarvardX Data Science PC program.
You can easily download the used dataset from the following Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. If you find any kind of troubles or differences, I share with you the dataset saved on my own computer via this Drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LOupDYXHQplgGaAegqG90C-bJ46HoIMt/view?usp=share_link. Maybe, if pleased (it is not required to run all code to its end, just ensure a fastest execution), you need to have the package Rtools installed in your R IDE system.
I have come up with a very queer solution to a well-known and analyzed problem, reaching a final model's AUC score of 1.
The difference among the files are due to my own current system and IDE device's configuration, and through them I want to ensure my research work and my endeavors to get the best outcome and report. Thanks.
